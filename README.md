Work Showcase


## Overview
This website is meant to showcase both my resume, as well as my coding capabilities. I list HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my skillset on my resume, but I haven't any work to show for. Thanks to GitHub pages, I'm now able to transition my head knowledge of coding to working knowledge. I've been familiar with coding, GitHub, and technical documentation for a few years now, but I can officically I'm comfortable working in it as well.

While I intend to continue my search for a technical writing position, having finally used all coding skills, it feels as though I have this super human power to able to design and build programs.
