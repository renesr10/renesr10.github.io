    <h1>Examples</h1>
    <p>It was at Orbridge where I developed my first knowledge database. Most of the departments already some-sort of training materials or process documentation. While I did not see my project's completion, I had made a decent start on it. It all started with updating a manual to use Orbridge's customer database website. Once updated, I introduced my set of training documentation into how to develop the travel preparation documents.   </p>
